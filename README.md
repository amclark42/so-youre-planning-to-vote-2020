# So You Want to Vote Under a Fascist Government

<!-- Introduction -->

## How to vote

Double-check the information and advice you get by word-of-mouth. Please do fact-check the points I've made here!

* Check your voter registration status.
  * Are you (still) registered?
  * Is your street address correct?
  * If necessary, apply or reapply ASAP.
    * If you're able and your local government allows it, consider emailing or faxing your voter registration forms and documents, rather than mailing them.
    * If mailing the application, allow at least a week for the application to arrive; two or three weeks to be on the safe side.
    * You may need to follow up to make sure your application has been accepted and is valid.
* Consider applying to vote by mail (or absentee), to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection or transmission.
  * If you're able and your local government allows it, consider emailing or faxing the application, rather than mailing it.
  * If mailing the application, do so ASAP. Allow at least a week for the application to arrive; two or three weeks to be on the safe side.
  * You may need to follow up to make sure your application has been accepted and is valid.
* VOTE.
  * Follow the instructions on your ballot carefully.
    * Make sure you're using a black or blue ballpoint pen.
    * Make sure your marks heavy and dark.
    * Try not to give anyone any excuse to say your ballot is invalid.
  * Do *not* take a photo of your ballot. Doing so may invalidate it.
    * You do have the right to talk about who you voted for.
  * If you plan to mail your ballot, try to get it to the post office ASAP, ideally a few days after you've received it.
    * Again, to be on the safe side, expect two or three weeks of transit.
    * Some states will only accept mail-in ballots up until the polls close on Election Day.
      * Others will accept mail-in ballots that have been postmarked by Election Day, regardless of when they arrive.
      * There are ongoing lawsuits over how states should handle mail-in ballots this year.
        * Consider checking every once in a while on the status of vote-by-mail in your state.
    * You may have the option to track your ballot online, so you'll be able to see when it arrives.
  * If you're voting by mail, many places offer secure drop boxes for returning your ballot.
    * These are often placed in high-traffic areas, in areas monitored by security cameras.
    * Ballots are collected from these boxes regularly: daily, if not more often.
  * If We can't vote remotely, or prefer not to do so, *try to vote early*.
  * If you're voting in person, try to do so during off-peak times.
      * Follow guidelines on reducing the spread of Covid-19.
        * Wear a mask over your nose and mouth while waiting in line, and indoors at the polling station.
        * Do not touch your face or the fabric of your mask.
        * Keep to a distance of at least 6 feet from other people.
        * Show respect for everyone else voting in-person, but especially show respect for poll workers, who will face increased risk to themselves and their families.
        * As soon as We can after voting, wash your hands for 20 seconds.
      * If you need time off of work in order to vote, check the guidelines for your area.
        * About 30 states have laws expressing your right to do so, usually with advance notice to your employer.
        * States differ on:
          * whether you need to meet certain criteria in order for your request to be protected by law;
          * whether you need to give notice to your employer, and how far in advance you need to do this;
          * the amount of time you'll have to vote;
          * whether your time off must be paid or unpaid; and
          * whether you need to give your employer proof that you voted.
        * Request time off from your employer ASAP.
          * Your employer may have their own guidelines on requests to vote during work hours.
          * If your employer denies you anything guaranteed to you by law, make sure they know that the law that supports you.
            * States may have information sheets on your rights, which We can provide to your boss.
            * If your employer doesn't back down, be loud about their illegal behavior!
            * Check your state government's website. You may be able to file a complaint against them.
      * <!-- If you're disenfranchised at your polling place... -->
      * If it's time for the polls to close and you haven't voted yet, remain in line. If you leave, you will not be able to cast a ballot in person.
  * Tell people that you've voted!
    * Voting is always important, but this year it's *really* important.
    * By sharing the fact that you voted, you're helping to normalize the idea that voting is important and that people care about it.
    * Try not to be dismissive of people who don't intend to vote.
      * Ask them why they've made that choice. Open a dialogue.
      * Don't preach. We can learn from each other!
      * But don't feel obligated to waste energy on someone who refuses to listen and won't acknowledge your opinions.
* Prepare to wait for the results.
  * With so many people voting by mail this year, **no one will know the outcome of the election for _weeks_**.
    * States have different laws about when mail-in ballots can start being counted.
    * States that allow ballots to be postmarked by Election Day will have to count newly-arrived ballots for weeks.
  * The wait will be painful, protracted, and exhausting.
  * Expect lawsuits.
    * Expect lawsuits over the validity of ballots.
    * Expect lawsuits over how long local governments are allowed to take in order to tally results.
    * Expect lawsuits over voter suppression tactics by local governments and poll workers.
  * Expect constant analysis and predictions from pretty much everyone.
    * Expect premature declarations of victory by Trump.
  * Try not to expect an outcome until one candidate concedes.


## Why say this now?

The Trump administration has systematically disassembled federal agencies, loaded the courts with Trump loyalists, fired whistleblowers, forced out inspectors general, incited violence by police and white supremacists. Trust in public institutions is at a severely low point. Russian misinformation campaigns are once again working to tip the electoral balance toward Trump. Meanwhile, there are still migrants and asylum-seekers in cages along the Mexican border. Five months into a global pandemic, Americans are still dying in large numbers, losing jobs in large numbers, feeling immense pressure to come out of isolation in large numbers. Police are still killing Black Americans, still getting little to no punishment for it.

Voting has always mattered. It matters now, more than many other years, because everything we're seeing now? It can get worse. It *will* get worse if Trump stays in office. Trump himself is a vindictive narcissist, but it would be a mistake to judge him as useless. The people he surrounds himself with are *ruthless* in hiding behind the chaos he spreads, shoring up power for themselves, exploiting every legal loophole they can find.

We cannot afford to be complacent. We have to vote Trump and his enablers out of office.


## What can we do now?

I feel hopeless a lot these days. Everything feels like too much. For me, despair and frustration come from feeling powerless, from feeling alone. Compiling this information was a way for me to start working past those feelings by acting and by reaching out. The advice here is just as much for myself as it is for you.

* We can put pressure on our local officials to add ballot dropboxes, and make sure there is enough personal protective equipment for poll workers.
* We can call our representatives and senators to demand funding for the U.S. Postal Service.
  * If they've already gone on the record in support of funding, let's thank them for it.
  * Keep calls short and focused on one issue.
  * An example introduction: "Hi, I'm [ name ] and I'm a constituent living at [ address ]. I urge the [ Senator, Representative ] to..."
* We can join local "get out the vote" campaigns.
  * We might send text messages or hand-written postcards reminding people to vote.
  * We might drive voters to ballot drop boxes or polling places.
  * We might bring water and food to people waiting in line.
* We can consider applying to be a poll worker, if our health and circumstances allow it.
  * Poll workers are often retirees. Many will choose not to risk their lives this year, and they shouldn't have to make that choice.
  * If there aren't enough poll workers, the number of polling places might go down.
  * With fewer polling places, there will be longer lines and everyone will have a higher risk of infection.
* In some states, we may be able to strengthen the voting process in other ways:
  * We might volunteer to register voters.
  * We might volunteer to monitor the polls.
  * We might volunteer to count votes.

We can look for all the people quietly helping in the background. We can look to all the people loudly demanding change. We can look at all the people standing beside us. We can *be* these people for others.

Just living can be an act of defiance. It's okay if some days, that's all we can manage.
